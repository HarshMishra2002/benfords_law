# benfords_law
When I work on any data science project I simply go to kaggle and download the csv file and start working on it.

I NEVER VALIDATE DATA.

There could be two reasons for that, Firstly I trust the source of the data too much that checking whether its appropriate or whether it has some parentage of fraud data is 
never a question. Second reason is that actually there are not too many tools available for it and so here comes the Benford’s Law for you.
